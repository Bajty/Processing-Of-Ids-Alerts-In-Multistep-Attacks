# Processing of IDS alerts in multi-step attacks

In this information age, we notice an increase in the quality of security threats. Organizations are forced to defend themselves against attacks in several steps. To identify the individual steps of attackers, we use several security technologies, among which we can include attack detection systems. Researchers or members of security teams have to deal with a large number of security events and alerts. A tool can help with this, which allows filtering relevant alerts and combining them into larger units without significant loss of information.
